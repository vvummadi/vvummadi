- ðŸ‘‹ if you see the line no : 6 and line No :9

for numeric index value 400 the conditions in the column B, column c, column D and column E are same

except the value in column "G".

And the column "G" the value is <45 and and column H is 0-59 than numeric index is 400 -- good
the next row 9 the conditions are  same as row 6. except the colmun G is >= 45.

in the row 6 we are saying the if the clumn "G" value is < 45 set the number index value 400
in the row 9 we are saying the if the clumn "G" value is >=45 set the number index value 400

less than 45 setting to 400 and > than 45 we are setting to 400

I am seeing ambiguity condition here
